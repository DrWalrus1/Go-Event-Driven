# Project: Handle Cancellations 

{{background}}

With more tickets to handle, refunds also become more frequent.
Because our webhook is asynchronous, it's possible that a ticket gets canceled
right after the purchase because someone else bought it first.
Right now, our operations team handles these cases manually; it's time we help them out a bit.

{{.Exercise}}

The new API includes a `status` field for each ticket.
We should differentiate between `confirmed` and `canceled` tickets.

1. For each `confirmed` ticket, keep the current behavior: publishing the `TicketBookingConfirmed` event.

2. For each `canceled` ticket, publish a new event instead: `TicketBookingCanceled`.

```go
type TicketBookingCanceled struct {
	Header        MessageHeader `json:"header"`
	TicketID      string      `json:"ticket_id"`
	CustomerEmail string      `json:"customer_email"`
	Price         Money       `json:"price"`
}
```

3. **Add a new message handler for this event.**
Remember to use a new subscriber with a unique consumer group.

The new handler should append a row to the `tickets-to-refund` spreadsheet with the following columns:

- Ticket ID
- Customer Email
- Price Amount
- Price Currency
